This project includes five mini-games:

brain-even: Determine if the number is even. You need to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

brain-calc: You are shown a random math expression, which you need to calculate and write down the correct answer.

brain-progression: You are shown a random arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the forgiven number.

brain-gcd: You are shown two random numbers. And you have to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

brain-prime: Determine if the number is prime. You need to answer yes if the number is prime, or no if it is not this way.
